# Sharing rules



## lvl 0. Share materials

* Basic process

    * Select a technical course. Other courses are also OK, but they can usually be studied "online" during a semester.
    * Ask course instructors for permission to share their materials unless the instructors have left the university or it is opensourced.
    * Send your file(s) to [maintainers](#want-to-help).
        * Send a folder as a `.zip` (`.tar`, `.7z`, etc.) archive (see sample structure [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EO_7EBNVICSLRz3lw-PCUOMMla7f7nQA?usp=sharing)). 
        * Send a single file as-is.
        * A repository (or a playlist) can be shared as a link ([example](https://github.com/ParfenovIgor/F21-Programming-Paradigms-Y-3)).
        * We'll create a new playlist for your videos and let you upload them
    * If you'd like, tell maintainers, and we will add your name to this `README.md` file. People should know their heroes!
        * We'll place your username on this page near the course you select if you've contributed several of them.
    * Keep contributing as much as possible allowed materials for more courses!

* Types of materials
    
    * Slides
    * Video records (e.g., with your camera during a lecture or your own tutorials)
    * Assignment / HW / Exam / Test problems and solutions
    * Cheatsheets
    * Your notes
