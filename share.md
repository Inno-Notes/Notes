## What and How to share

### What we collect   
* Slides
* Video recordings (e.g., with your camera during a lecture or your own tutorials)
* Assignment / HW / Exam / Test problems and solutions
* Cheatsheets
* Your notes

### Basic process
* Select a course
* Ask course instructors for permission to share their materials unless the instructors have left the university <!-- TODO --> or it is opensourced.
* Send your file(s) to [maintainers](./README.md#want-to-help).
    * Send a folder(s) as `.zip` (`.tar`, `.7z`, etc.) archive(s) (see sample structure [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EO_7EBNVICSLRz3lw-PCUOMMla7f7nQA?usp=sharing)).
    * Send a single file as-is.
    * A repository (or a playlist) can be shared as a link ([example](https://github.com/ParfenovIgor/F21-Programming-Paradigms-Y-3)).
    * We'll create a new playlist for your videos and upload them
* If you'd like, tell maintainers, and we will add your name to this `README.md` file. People should know their heroes!
    * We'll place your username on this page near the course you select if you've contributed several courses.
* Keep contributing as much as possible allowed materials for more courses!

### Become a Notes maintainer

* If you'd like to become a maintainer, just stay in our chat and send materials whenever you can.

* Pls don't ignore when there appear calls to action. We're all volunteers and expect that you will give some time to this project.

* When there come newbie students, tell them about our project. It may make their life easier in the first years.

* Invite them to contribute. This will create a stable supply of maintainers.

* If you'd like, we can add you to the `Inno-Notes` organization on GitHub. Just [contact us](./README.md#want-to-help). Don't forget to accept an invitation on GitHub and change [organization visibility](https://github.com/orgs/Inno-Notes/people) to `Public` after you become a contributor!
